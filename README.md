# NHAI_Road_Accident_Cause_Analysis
This project analyzes NHAI accident data using SQL and Power BI to identify trends, accident-prone locations, causes, and safety measures. It examines vehicle types, emergency response times, weather impact, and insurance validity. Insights help improve road safety, traffic policies, and emergency response planning.
Road safety is a critical concern, and this project dives deep into NHAI accident data to uncover patterns, risk factors, and areas needing intervention. Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, the project provides an in-depth analysis of accident trends, causes, and the effectiveness of safety measures on Indian highways.

1. Key Insights
Accident Trends Over Time: Identifies seasonal and time-based accident patterns.
High-Risk Locations: Highlights the most accident-prone highways for better traffic management.
Cause Analysis: Investigates major contributors like over-speeding, drunk driving, and distractions.
Emergency Response Efficiency: Evaluates response times to identify critical delays.
Vehicle Type Impact: Analyzes accident frequency across cars, bikes, trucks, buses, and auto-rickshaws.
Weather & Road Conditions: Studies how factors like rain, fog, potholes, and icy roads influence accidents.
Safety Measures Effectiveness: Assesses how seatbelts, helmets, and airbags impact casualty rates.
Insurance Validity Analysis: Compares accident rates based on valid vs. expired insurance.

2. Tech Stack
SQL: For data querying and preprocessing.
Power BI: For interactive dashboards and data visualization.

3. Why It Matters
By identifying accident-prone zones and key risk factors, this project helps:
 1. Improve highway safety regulations.
 2. Optimize policing and traffic enforcement.
 3. Enhance emergency response strategies.

This analysis aims to contribute to safer roads by providing data-driven insights for policymakers, traffic authorities, and road safety organizations.
